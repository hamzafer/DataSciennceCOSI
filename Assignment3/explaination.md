## Approach to prepare OVO Dataset for Binary Classification

### Steps Followed:

1. **Load Dataset and Identify Classes:**
    - Load the `fgl` dataset to create a One-vs-One (OVO) classifier using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for
      binary classification.

2. **Set Seed for Reproducibility:**
    - `set.seed(2)` is used to ensure the random sampling is reproducible.

3. **Prepare Training and Test Sets:**
    - The dataset is split into two subsets: a training set and a test set, each containing half of the dataset.

4. **Identify Unique Class Labels:**
    - Determine the unique classes in the dataset and the number of classes `k`.

5. **Initialize Predictions Storage:**
    - A matrix `predictions` is initialized to store the prediction results for the test set.

6. **Perform OVO Binary Classification:**
    - Nested loops iterate over all pairs of classes. For each pair, the function `mySelectClasses` is called to filter
      the training set for the two classes.
    - An LDA model is trained for each class pair, and predictions are made for the test set.

7. **Majority Voting:**
    - A majority vote is applied across all binary classifiers' predictions to determine the final class for each sample
      in the test set.

8. **Create Confusion Matrix:**
    - A confusion matrix `t` is generated to compare the OVO classifier's predictions with the actual class labels.

### Example Usage:

To access the LDA model's predictions for the first pair of classes, you would use:

```r
ovo_predictions <- predictions[,1]
actual_classes <- test.set[, "type"]
confusion_matrix <- table(ovo_predictions, actual_classes)
